- Automates lead discovery through Google Maps and web scraping
- Qualifies leads based on website quality (Lighthouse scores)
- Enriches leads with sales intelligence
- Manages leads through a simple pipeline

### Success Metrics
- User activation rate (first scrape within 24h of signup)
- Credit utilization rate
- User retention (monthly active users)
- Lead quality score (% of qualified leads)

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Lead Discovery (Google Places API)

We use the **Google Places API (New)** - specifically the **Text Search API** with rectangular bounds - to discover businesses.

#### How It Works
1. User draws a rectangle on the map
2. System divides rectangle into grid cells (2km x 2km each)
3. For each cell, call Google Places Text Search API with `locationRestriction.rectangle`
4. Filter results based on user criteria (has phone, has website, etc.)
5. Return only matching leads, charge 1 credit per valid lead

#### API Used
```
POST https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText

Body:
{
  "textQuery": "restaurants",
  "locationRestriction": {
    "rectangle": {
      "low": { "latitude": 12.9, "longitude": 77.5 },
      "high": { "latitude": 12.95, "longitude": 77.55 }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Data Retrieved from Google Places API
| Field | API Field | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Business Name | `displayName` | Identification |
| Address | `formattedAddress` | Location |
| Phone | `nationalPhoneNumber` | Contact |
| Website | `websiteUri` | For Lighthouse analysis |
| Rating | `rating` | Quality indicator |
| Review Count | `userRatingCount` | Popularity |
| Business Type | `types` | Categorization |
| Price Level | `priceLevel` | Market segment |
| Location | `location` | Map display |
| Google Maps URL | `googleMapsUri` | Quick access |

**Credit Cost:** 1 credit per valid lead (no base cost)

### 3.2 Lead Qualification & Utilities
| Feature | Description | Credit Cost |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Lighthouse Analysis | Website performance/SEO scoring | 1 credit per analysis |
| Technical Analysis | Tech stack detection | 1 credit per analysis |

| Lighthouse Analysis | Website performance/SEO scoring | 1 credit per analysis |
| Technical Analysis | Tech stack detection | 1 credit per analysis |
| Sales Intelligence | AI-powered business research (Perplexity) | 1 credit per lookup |

### 3.3 Lead Generation Credits
| Action | Credit Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Per valid lead (matching filters) | 1 credit |
| Leads not matching filters | FREE |
| Duplicate leads | FREE |

**Example:** User wants 10 leads with phone numbers. System finds 50 businesses, 10 have phones. Cost: **10 credits**

### 3.4 Lead Management

## 5. Credit System

### 5.1 Credit Model
```typescript
interface UserCredits {
  userId: string;
  balance: number;           // Current credit balance
  totalEarned: number;       // Lifetime credits earned (coupons)
  totalSpent: number;        // Lifetime credits spent
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

### 5.2 Credit Transactions
```typescript
interface CreditTransaction {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  amount: number;            // Positive = credit, Negative = debit
  type: 'COUPON_REDEEM' | 'SCRAPE_JOB' | 'LEAD_GENERATED' | 'UTILITY_USE' | 'REFUND';
  description: string;       // Human-readable description
  referenceId?: string;      // Job ID, coupon code, etc.
  balanceAfter: number;      // Balance after transaction
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 5.3 Credit Deduction Logic
```typescript
// Before starting any operation
async function checkAndDeductCredits(userId: string, amount: number, type: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const user = await getUserCredits(userId);

  if (user.balance < amount) {
    throw new InsufficientCreditsError(`Need ${amount} credits, have ${user.balance}`);
  }

  // Deduct credits atomically
  await deductCredits(userId, amount, type);
  return true;
}

// On operation failure
async function refundCredits(userId: string, amount: number, reason: string): Promise<void> {
  await addCredits(userId, amount, 'REFUND', reason);
}
```

### 5.4 Credit Costs Summary
| Operation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Per valid lead from scrape | 1 credit |
| Lighthouse analysis | 1 credit |
| Technical analysis | 1 credit |
| Sales intelligence (Perplexity) | 1 credit |

**Scraping is free** - you only pay for valid leads that match your filters.

### 5.5 Low Balance Handling
- Show credit balance prominently in dashboard header
- Warning banner when balance < 10 credits
- Block operations when balance = 0
- Show "Get More Credits" CTA -> WhatsApp link

---

## 6. Coupon Management

### 6.1 Coupon Model
```typescript
interface Coupon {
  id: string;
  code: string;              // Unique, uppercase, 8-12 chars (e.g., "BETA100", "LAUNCH50")
  credits: number;           // Credits to award (admin decides amount)
  maxRedemptions: number;    // How many times can be used (1 = single-use)
  currentRedemptions: number;
  expiresAt?: Date;          // Optional expiry
  isActive: boolean;
  createdBy: string;         // Admin user ID
  createdAt: Date;
  note?: string;             // Internal note (e.g., "For Twitter giveaway")
}
```

### 6.2 Coupon Redemption Model
```typescript
interface CouponRedemption {
  id: string;
  couponId: string;
  userId: string;
  redeemedAt: Date;
  creditsAwarded: number;
}
```

### 6.3 Coupon Generation (Admin)
```
Admin Panel -> Coupons -> Generate New
- Code: Auto-generate or custom
- Credits: [input field] (any amount)
- Max Redemptions: 1 (single-use) or N (multi-use)
- Expiry: Optional date
- Note: Internal note

-> Generate -> Shows coupon code
-> Option to copy or email directly
```

### 6.4 Coupon Redemption (User)
```
Dashboard -> "Have a coupon?" -> Enter code
- Validate code exists and is active
- Check if user already redeemed (prevent double-redemption)
- Check max redemptions not exceeded
- Check not expired
- Award credits
- Record redemption
- Show success message with credits awarded
```

### 6.5 Bulk Coupon Generation
Admin can generate multiple single-use coupons at once:
```
Generate Bulk -> Count: 10, Credits: 100 each
-> Creates: LEEDO-A1B2, LEEDO-C3D4, LEEDO-E5F6, ...
-> Export as CSV for distribution
```

---

## 7. Admin Panel

### 7.1 Admin Route Protection

**CRITICAL:** Admin routes must be completely separate and obscure.

```
Public routes:     /login, /signup, /dashboard, /leads, etc.
Admin routes:      /nucleus-admin-{random-hash}/...

Example:           /nucleus-admin-x7k9m2/dashboard
```

The admin URL prefix should be:
- Stored in environment variable: `ADMIN_URL_PREFIX=nucleus-admin-x7k9m2`
- Not guessable (no `/admin`, `/panel`, `/manage`)
- Changed periodically for security

### 7.2 Admin Authentication
- Separate admin login page at `/{ADMIN_URL_PREFIX}/login`
- Only users with `role: 'ADMIN'` can access
- Additional password or PIN for admin access (optional)
- IP whitelist for admin routes (optional, production)

### 7.3 Admin Dashboard Features

---

## 8. Audit Logging

### 8.1 What to Log
Every external API call and significant action must be logged:

```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  userEmail: string;
  action: AuditAction;
  resource: string;           // 'lead', 'scrape_job', 'coupon', etc.
  resourceId?: string;
  details: Record<string, any>;
  externalApi?: string;       // 'google_maps', 'google_places', 'perplexity', 'lighthouse'
  apiRequestId?: string;      // External API request ID if available
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  duration?: number;          // Request duration in ms
  status: 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILURE';
  errorMessage?: string;
}

type AuditAction =
  | 'USER_LOGIN'
  | 'USER_LOGOUT'
  | 'USER_SIGNUP'
  | 'COUPON_REDEEM'
  | 'SCRAPE_JOB_START'
  | 'SCRAPE_JOB_COMPLETE'
  | 'SCRAPE_JOB_FAIL'
  | 'LEAD_CREATE'
  | 'LEAD_UPDATE'
  | 'LEAD_DELETE'
  | 'LIGHTHOUSE_RUN'
  | 'PERPLEXITY_QUERY'
  | 'GOOGLE_MAPS_SCRAPE'
  | 'GOOGLE_PLACES_API'
  | 'CREDIT_DEDUCT'
  | 'CREDIT_REFUND'
  | 'EXPORT_DATA'
  | 'ADMIN_ACTION';
```

### 8.2 External API Logging
Special attention to external API calls for cost tracking:

```typescript
interface ExternalApiLog {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  api: 'GOOGLE_MAPS' | 'GOOGLE_PLACES' | 'PERPLEXITY' | 'LIGHTHOUSE';
  endpoint: string;
  requestPayload?: Record<string, any>;  // Sanitized, no secrets
  responseStatus: number;
  responseTime: number;
  creditsCharged: number;
  jobId?: string;
}
```

### 8.3 Log Retention
- Audit logs: 90 days (configurable)
- External API logs: 30 days
- Aggregate statistics: Forever

---

## 9. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

### 9.1 Data Isolation Requirements
**CRITICAL:** Each user's data must be completely isolated.

- User A cannot see User B's leads
- User A cannot see User B's scrape jobs
- User A cannot see User B's activity logs
- User A cannot access User B's API keys

### 9.2 Implementation

#### Database Level
Every user-owned table must have `userId` column with index:

```sql
-- All queries must include userId filter
SELECT * FROM leads WHERE user_id = $1 AND ...
SELECT * FROM scrape_jobs WHERE user_id = $1 AND ...

-- Add Row Level Security (RLS) in Postgres
ALTER TABLE leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY leads_isolation ON leads
  USING (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::uuid);
```

#### Application Level
```typescript
// Middleware to set user context
app.addHook('preHandler', async (request, reply) => {
  if (request.user) {
    // Set for RLS policies
    await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT set_config('app.current_user_id', ${request.user.id}, true)`;
  }
});

// All service methods must scope by userId
class LeadService {
  async getLeads(userId: string, filters: LeadFilters) {
    return prisma.lead.findMany({
      where: {
        userId,  // ALWAYS include userId
        ...filters
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### 9.3 Shared Resources
Some resources are shared (read-only for users):
- Scraping regions
- Tags (system-defined)
- Service configurations

## 18. Simplified Leads System

### 18.1 No Two-Level System
**REMOVE:** The current "Prospects vs Leads" two-level system.

**NEW:** Single "Leads" system where all discovered businesses are leads.

### 18.2 Simplified Pipeline Stages
**OLD (Remove):**
```
NEW -> CONTACTED -> QUALIFIED -> PROPOSAL -> NEGOTIATION -> WON/LOST
```

**NEW (4 stages only):**
```
NEW -> CONTACTED -> INTERESTED -> CLOSED (Won/Lost)
```

| Stage | Description | Color |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| NEW | Just discovered, not contacted | Gray |
| CONTACTED | Reached out, awaiting response | Blue |
| INTERESTED | Responded positively, in conversation | Orange |
| CLOSED | Deal done (won) or rejected (lost) | Green/Red |

### 18.3 Lead Status Substates
For CLOSED stage, add a `closedReason`:
- `WON` - Converted to customer
- `LOST_NOT_INTERESTED` - Not interested
- `LOST_NO_BUDGET` - Budget issues
- `LOST_COMPETITOR` - Went with competitor
- `LOST_NO_RESPONSE` - Never responded

### 18.4 Threaded Notes/Activity System

**Current Problem:** Adding notes is clunky, activities are separate from notes.

**New Design:** Single threaded timeline combining notes and activities.

```typescript
interface LeadActivity {
  id: string;
  leadId: string;
  userId: string;
  type: 'NOTE' | 'CALL' | 'EMAIL' | 'MEETING' | 'STAGE_CHANGE' | 'SYSTEM';
  content: string;           // Note text or activity description
  metadata?: {
    from?: string;           // For stage changes
    to?: string;
    duration?: number;       // For calls (minutes)
    outcome?: string;        // Call/meeting outcome
  };
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**UI Pattern:**
```
Lead Detail Page
├── Header (Name, Website, Score, Stage Dropdown)
├── Contact Info (Email, Phone, Address)
├── Quick Actions (Call, Email, Add Note)
└── Activity Timeline
    ├── [Today]
    │   ├── Note: "Sent follow-up email about pricing"
    │   └── Stage changed: CONTACTED -> INTERESTED
    ├── [Yesterday]
    │   ├── Call: "Discussed requirements, 15 min"
    │   └── Note: "They need e-commerce site, budget ~2L"
    └── [Jan 20]
        └── System: "Lead created from Google Maps scrape"
```

**Adding Notes - Simplified:**
- Single text input at top of timeline
- Press Enter or click to add
- Optional: Select type (Note/Call/Email/Meeting)
- No modal, no extra clicks

---

## 19. Map-Based Region Selection

### 19.1 Overview
Replace predefined city dropdowns with interactive map drawing.

**Current System (Remove):**
- Dropdown with 4 predefined cities
- Fixed regions stored in database

**New System:**
- Interactive map (Leaflet/Mapbox)
- User draws rectangle to select area
- System divides into grid cells
- Each cell is searched separately
- Progress shown in real-time

### 19.2 User Flow

```
1. User goes to /scraping
2. Map loads centered on their location (or last used location)
3. User clicks "Draw Region" button
4. User draws a rectangle on the map
5. System shows:
   - Area size (e.g., "25km x 30km")
   - Estimated grid cells (e.g., "~75 cells")
   - Estimated credits (e.g., "25 + ~150 leads = ~175 credits")
6. User enters business type (e.g., "restaurants", "gyms")
7. User clicks "Start Scrape"
8. System:
   - Divides rectangle into 2km x 2km cells
   - Queues search for each cell
   - Shows progress map with cells colored:
     - Gray: Pending
     - Blue: In progress
     - Green: Completed
     - Red: Failed
9. Results stream in as each cell completes
```

### 19.3 Technical Implementation

#### Grid Division Algorithm
```typescript
interface Rectangle {
  southwest: { lat: number; lng: number };
  northeast: { lat: number; lng: number };
}

interface GridCell {
  id: string;
  bounds: Rectangle;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED';
  leadsFound: number;
}

function divideIntoGrid(region: Rectangle, cellSizeKm: number = 2): GridCell[] {
  const cells: GridCell[] = [];

  // Calculate number of cells needed
  const latDiff = region.northeast.lat - region.southwest.lat;
  const lngDiff = region.northeast.lng - region.southwest.lng;

  // Approximate: 1 degree lat = 111km, 1 degree lng = 111km * cos(lat)
  const avgLat = (region.northeast.lat + region.southwest.lat) / 2;
  const kmPerDegreeLat = 111;
  const kmPerDegreeLng = 111 * Math.cos(avgLat * Math.PI / 180);

  const latStep = cellSizeKm / kmPerDegreeLat;
  const lngStep = cellSizeKm / kmPerDegreeLng;

  for (let lat = region.southwest.lat; lat < region.northeast.lat; lat += latStep) {
    for (let lng = region.southwest.lng; lng < region.northeast.lng; lng += lngStep) {
      cells.push({
        id: `${lat.toFixed(4)}_${lng.toFixed(4)}`,
        bounds: {
          southwest: { lat, lng },
          northeast: {
            lat: Math.min(lat + latStep, region.northeast.lat),
            lng: Math.min(lng + lngStep, region.northeast.lng)
          }
        },
        status: 'PENDING',
        leadsFound: 0
      });
    }
  }

  return cells;
}
```

#### Google Places API Call (per cell)
```typescript
async function searchCell(cell: GridCell, query: string): Promise<Place[]> {
  const response = await fetch('https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Goog-Api-Key': GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY,
      'X-Goog-FieldMask': 'places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.websiteUri,places.nationalPhoneNumber,places.rating'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      textQuery: query,
      locationRestriction: {
        rectangle: {
          low: {
            latitude: cell.bounds.southwest.lat,
            longitude: cell.bounds.southwest.lng
          },
          high: {
            latitude: cell.bounds.northeast.lat,
            longitude: cell.bounds.northeast.lng
          }
        }
      },
      maxResultCount: 20
    })
  });

  return response.json();
}
```

### 19.4 Region Size Limits
To prevent abuse and excessive API costs:

| Plan | Max Area | Max Cells | Cell Size |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Free/Basic | 100 km² | 25 cells | 2km x 2km |
| Future Pro | 500 km² | 125 cells | 2km x 2km |

**Validation:**
```typescript
function validateRegion(region: Rectangle): { valid: boolean; error?: string } {
  const areaKm2 = calculateArea(region);
  const MAX_AREA = 100; // km²

  if (areaKm2 > MAX_AREA) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: `Region too large (${areaKm2.toFixed(0)} km²). Maximum is ${MAX_AREA} km².`
    };
  }

  return { valid: true };
}
```

### 19.5 Saved Regions (User Level)
Users can save regions for quick re-use:

```typescript
interface SavedRegion {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;                    // e.g., "Downtown Bangalore"
  bounds: Rectangle;
  lastUsed: Date;
  timesUsed: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**UI:**
- "Save this region" button after drawing
- "My Regions" dropdown to quickly load saved regions
- Delete/rename saved regions in /regions page

### 19.6 Smart Scraping with Lead Filters

#### Overview
Users define quality filters BEFORE scraping. The system continues scraping until it finds the requested number of leads that match ALL filters.

#### User Flow
```
1. User draws region on map
2. User enters business type ("restaurants")
3. User sets "I want [10] leads"
4. User sets filters:
   ☑ Must have phone number
   ☑ Must have website
   ☐ Must have email
   ☐ Rating above [4.0]
   ☐ Review count above [10]
   ☐ No website (for web dev leads)
5. User clicks "Start Scrape"
6. System scrapes cells until 10 VALID leads found
7. User charged for valid leads only
```

#### Filter Options

| Filter | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Has Phone | Business has phone number | Off |
| Has Website | Business has website URL | Off |
| Has Email | Email found on website | Off |
| No Website | For finding leads needing websites | Off |
| Min Rating | Minimum star rating (1-5) | None |
| Min Reviews | Minimum review count | None |
| Max Reviews | Maximum reviews (newer businesses) | None |
| Business Status | Only OPERATIONAL businesses | On |
| Price Level | Filter by $ to $$$$ | Any |

**Note:** "Has Website" and "No Website" are mutually exclusive.

#### Filter Model
```typescript
interface ScrapeFilters {
  // Contact filters
  hasPhone?: boolean;
  hasWebsite?: boolean;
  hasEmail?: boolean;       // Requires website scraping
  noWebsite?: boolean;      // For web dev lead gen

  // Rating filters
  minRating?: number;       // 1.0 - 5.0
  maxRating?: number;
  minReviews?: number;
  maxReviews?: number;

  // Business filters
  businessStatus?: 'OPERATIONAL' | 'ANY';
  priceLevel?: number[];    // [1, 2] = $ and $$

  // Target
  targetLeadCount: number;  // Stop when this many valid leads found
  maxCellsToSearch?: number; // Safety limit (default: 100)
}
```

#### Scraping Logic
```typescript
async function smartScrape(
  region: Rectangle,
  query: string,
  filters: ScrapeFilters,
  userId: string
): Promise<ScrapeResult> {
  const cells = divideIntoGrid(region);
  const validLeads: Lead[] = [];
  let cellsSearched = 0;
  let totalFound = 0;
  let totalFiltered = 0;

  for (const cell of cells) {
    // Stop if we have enough valid leads
    if (validLeads.length >= filters.targetLeadCount) {
      break;
    }

    // Safety limit
    if (cellsSearched >= (filters.maxCellsToSearch || 100)) {
      break;
    }

    // Search this cell
    const places = await searchCell(cell, query);
    cellsSearched++;
    totalFound += places.length;

    for (const place of places) {
      // Apply filters
      if (matchesFilters(place, filters)) {
        // Check for duplicates
        if (!isDuplicate(place, userId)) {
          validLeads.push(place);
          totalFiltered++;

          if (validLeads.length >= filters.targetLeadCount) {
            break;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Update job progress
    await updateJobProgress(jobId, {
      cellsSearched,
      totalFound,
      validLeads: validLeads.length,
      target: filters.targetLeadCount
    });
  }

  return {
    leads: validLeads,
    stats: {
      cellsSearched,
      totalFound,
      totalFiltered,
      duplicatesSkipped: totalFound - totalFiltered - validLeads.length
    }
  };
}

function matchesFilters(place: Place, filters: ScrapeFilters): boolean {
  // Phone filter
  if (filters.hasPhone && !place.nationalPhoneNumber) {
    return false;
  }

  // Website filters (mutually exclusive)
  if (filters.hasWebsite && !place.websiteUri) {
    return false;
  }
  if (filters.noWebsite && place.websiteUri) {
    return false;
  }

  // Rating filters
  if (filters.minRating && (!place.rating || place.rating < filters.minRating)) {
    return false;
  }
  if (filters.maxRating && place.rating && place.rating > filters.maxRating) {
    return false;
  }

  // Review count filters
  if (filters.minReviews && (!place.userRatingCount || place.userRatingCount < filters.minReviews)) {
    return false;
  }
  if (filters.maxReviews && place.userRatingCount && place.userRatingCount > filters.maxReviews) {
    return false;
  }

  // Business status
  if (filters.businessStatus === 'OPERATIONAL' && place.businessStatus !== 'OPERATIONAL') {
    return false;
  }

  // Price level
  if (filters.priceLevel?.length && !filters.priceLevel.includes(place.priceLevel)) {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

#### Credit Charging
```
Per valid lead: 1 credit
NO base job cost

Example:
- User wants 10 leads with phone numbers
- System searches 15 cells, finds 47 businesses
- 10 match the "has phone" filter
- Cost: 10 credits (that's it!)

NOT charged for:
- Businesses that don't match filters
- Duplicate businesses
- Failed cell searches
- The scraping itself (only results)
```

**Simple rule:** You only pay for leads you actually get.

### 19.7 Google Places API Data Fields

The Google Places API (New) provides extensive data. We should capture these fields for each lead:

#### Essential Fields (Always Capture)
| Field | API Field | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Name | `displayName` | Business name |
| Place ID | `id` | Unique identifier, prevent duplicates |
| Address | `formattedAddress` | Full address |
| Location | `location` | Lat/lng for map display |
| Phone | `nationalPhoneNumber` | Contact |
| Website | `websiteUri` | For Lighthouse analysis |
| Types | `types` | Business categories |
| Rating | `rating` | Average rating (1-5) |
| Review Count | `userRatingCount` | Number of reviews |
| Price Level | `priceLevel` | $ to $$$$ |
| Business Status | `businessStatus` | OPERATIONAL, CLOSED, etc. |

#### Enrichment Fields (Capture if Available)
| Field | API Field | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Opening Hours | `regularOpeningHours` | Operating schedule |
| Photos | `photos` | First photo for preview |
| Editorial Summary | `editorialSummary` | AI description |
| Google Maps Link | `googleMapsUri` | Quick access |

#### Business Intelligence Fields (Future)
| Field | API Field | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|

| Dine In | `dineIn` | Service offerings |
| Reservable | `reservable` | Business model indicator |
| Price Range | `priceRange` | Detailed pricing |
| Reviews | `reviews` | Sentiment analysis |

#### Field Mask for API Request
```typescript
const FIELD_MASK = [
  'places.id',
  'places.displayName',
  'places.formattedAddress',
  'places.location',
  'places.nationalPhoneNumber',
  'places.internationalPhoneNumber',
  'places.websiteUri',
  'places.googleMapsUri',
  'places.types',
  'places.primaryType',

  'places.userRatingCount',
  'places.priceLevel',
  'places.businessStatus',
  'places.regularOpeningHours',
  'places.photos',
  'places.editorialSummary'
].join(',');
```

**Note:** Different fields have different pricing tiers. We use mostly "Pro" tier fields to balance data richness with cost.

## 20. UI Improvement Requirements

### 20.1 Dashboard Redesign
**Current Issues:**
- Too cluttered
- Not focused on key actions

**New Design Principles:**
- Credit balance prominent (top right)
- "New Scrape" as primary CTA
- Recent scrapes with quick status
- Recent leads preview
- Clean, minimal

**Dashboard Layout:**

### 20.2 Lead List Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- Too many columns
- Hard to scan
- Bulk actions hidden

**New Design:**
- Card-based or compact list view toggle
- Key info only: Name, Website Status, Stage, Last Activity
- Inline stage change (dropdown)
- Quick actions on hover
- Bulk select with floating action bar

### 20.3 Lead Detail Page Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- Notes/activities hard to add
- Too much scrolling

**New Design:**

```

### 20.4 Scraping Page Redesign
**New Flow:**
1. Full-width map
2. Draw rectangle tool
3. Side panel with:
   - Business type input
   - Region stats (area, cells)
   - Credit estimate
   - Start button

**During Scrape:**
- Map shows cell progress (colored squares)
- Side panel shows:
  - Progress bar
  - Leads found count
  - Current cell being scraped
  - Live result preview

### 20.5 Design System Updates
- Consistent spacing (4px grid)
- Limited color palette
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Mobile-first responsive
- Loading states for all actions
- Empty states with helpful CTAs

---

## 21. Additional Feature Suggestions

### 21.1 Lead Scoring System (MVP)
Automatically score leads based on multiple factors:

| Factor | Weight | Score Logic |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Website Status | 40% | No website = 100, Poor (<50) = 80, Moderate = 40, Good = 10 |
| Has Email | 15% | Found = 100, Not found = 0 |
| Has Phone | 15% | Found = 100, Not found = 0 |
| Business Type Match | 15% | Exact match = 100, Related = 50 |
| Reviews/Rating | 15% | Low reviews = higher score (newer business) |

**Display:** Show composite score (0-100) with color coding:
- 🔥 Hot (80-100): Red badge
- 🟠 Warm (50-79): Orange badge
- 🔵 Cool (0-49): Blue badge

### 21.2 Duplicate Detection (MVP)
Prevent duplicate leads across scrapes:

```typescript
// Check for duplicates before creating lead
async function isDuplicate(lead: NewLead, userId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const existing = await prisma.lead.findFirst({
    where: {
      userId,
      OR: [
        { phone: lead.phone },
        { email: lead.email },
        { website: normalizeUrl(lead.website) },
        {
          AND: [
            { name: { contains: lead.name, mode: 'insensitive' } },
            { city: lead.city }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  });
  return !!existing;
}
```

**UI:** Show "X duplicates skipped" after scrape completes.

### 21.3 Smart Filters & Saved Views (MVP)
Let users save filter combinations:

```typescript
interface SavedFilter {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;              // "Hot Leads in Bangalore"
  filters: {
    stages?: string[];
    scoreMin?: number;
    scoreMax?: number;
    hasEmail?: boolean;
    hasPhone?: boolean;
    hasWebsite?: boolean;
    createdAfter?: Date;
    tags?: string[];
  };
  isDefault: boolean;        // Show on dashboard
}
```

**Preset Filters:**
- "Hot Leads" (score > 80)
- "No Website" (website = null)
- "Has Contact" (email OR phone exists)
- "Stale" (no activity > 7 days)

### 21.4 Follow-up Reminders (MVP)
Set reminders for leads:

```typescript
interface Reminder {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  leadId: string;
  remindAt: Date;
  note: string;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'DISMISSED';
}
```

**UI:**
- "Remind me" button on lead detail
- Quick options: "Tomorrow", "In 3 days", "Next week", "Custom"
- Dashboard widget: "Due Today" with reminder count
- In-app notification when reminder is due

### 21.5 Keyboard Shortcuts (MVP)
For power users:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `n` | New scrape |
| `g l` | Go to leads |
| `g d` | Go to dashboard |
| `/` | Focus search |
| `j/k` | Navigate list (down/up) |
| `Enter` | Open selected lead |
| `e` | Edit lead |
| `Esc` | Close modal/go back |
| `?` | Show shortcuts help |

### 21.6 Quick Actions / Command Palette (Future)
`Cmd+K` to open command palette:
- Search leads by name
